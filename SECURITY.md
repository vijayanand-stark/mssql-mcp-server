## Security Policy

Security is a priority. If you discover a vulnerability in the MSSQL MCP server, please report it privately so we can fix it quickly.

### Reporting a vulnerability

Send details to [connor.r.england@gmail.com](mailto:connor.r.england@gmail.com) with the subject line "Security Report". Include:

- A description of the issue and potential impact
- Steps or scripts to reproduce
- The commit hash or release version tested

Please do **not** open public GitHub issues for security findings. You’ll receive an acknowledgement within 2 business days and status updates until the fix ships.

### Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices. Once a fix is available, we’ll credit researchers in the release notes unless anonymity is requested.
